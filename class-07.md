## Who is Roy Fielding?
***computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.
He is an authority on computer network architecture and co-founded the Apache HTTP Server project.***
## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
***Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. 
But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.***

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
***Kind of. A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser...***

## What does a GET do?
***GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed. But the important thing here is that very different kinds of nouns can be treated the same.
Whether the noun is an image, text, video, an mp3, a slideshow, whatever. I can GET all of those things the same way given a URL.***

## What does a POST do?
 ***one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST***
 
## What does PUT do?
***if a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.***

## What does PATCH do?
 ***to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH. 
The only thing left to figure out is what the data models should look like.***
