 SQL                    |  NoSQL
|------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------|
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS);|whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
SQL databases are table based databases|NoSQL databases are document based
SQL databases have predefined schema |NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.)
SQL databases are vertically scalable|NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable
SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data|In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
***SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment***

## Give a real world example.
***MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL***

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
***NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.***

## Give a real world example.
***MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb***

 ## which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
 ***NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage***
 
## Which type of database is best for scalability?
***In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc,***

## What does SQL stand for?
structured query language
## What is a relational database?
***A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data***

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?
***A Relational database data structure works by using multiple tables,***

## What is a ‘schema’?
***organize database objects into logical groups to make them more manageable.****

## What is a NoSQL database?
***provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.***

## How does it work?
***is a database system which supports fast access to large binary objects (docs, jpgs etc) using a key based access strategy.***

## What is inside of a Mongo database?
***Databases, collections, documents***


## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
***MongoDB provides a flexible developer interface for teams that are building applications that don’t need all of the safety features offered by relational systems. A common example of such an application is a web application that doesn't depend on structured schemas; it can easily serve unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data, all from the same MongoDB collection.***

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
***don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have***
