## Rebuilt with React
***React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.***

***As one of the oldest React libraries, React-Bootstrap has evolved and grown alongside React, making it an excellent choice as your UI foundation.***

## Bootstrap at its core
***Built with compatibility in mind, we embrace our bootstrap core and strive to be compatible with the world's largest UI ecosystem.***

***By relying entirely on the Bootstrap stylesheet, React-Bootstrap just works with the thousands of Bootstrap themes you already love.***

## Accessible by default
***The React component model gives us more control over form and function of each component.***

***Each component is implemented with accessibility in mind. The result is a set of accessible-by-default components, over what is possible from plain Bootstrap.***

## State and Lifecycle
***This page introduces the concept of state and lifecycle in a React component. You can find a detailed component API reference here.***

***Consider the ticking clock example from one of the previous sections. In Rendering Elements, we have only learned one way to update the UI. We call ReactDOM.render() to change the rendered output***

## Handling Events
***Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:***

* React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
* With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

## The tutorial is divided into several sections:

* Setup for the Tutorial will give you a starting point to follow the tutorial.
* Overview will teach you the fundamentals of React: components, props, and state.
* Completing the Game will teach you the most common techniques in React development.
* Adding Time Travel will give you a deeper insight into the unique strengths of React.
