## What ideas do you have for projects?
***i was thinking about a project where clients could visit an open source library website for books that could be read and also a feature where you could listen to the whole book if preferd and also users can upload their own books be it free or with charge***  

## What would your model be that you can control and update the view with?
***i think i would use bootstrap cards to represent books and with clients being able to add those books to their personal signed in accounts on the website***

## What API(s) could you use to make this a reality?
***The Books API would be very helpful i think***
